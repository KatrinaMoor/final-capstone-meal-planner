# Meal-Planner
A meal planning application that allows users to create their own library of recipes and plan meals for the week using existing recipes and ingredients. Developed with a team of four in an Agile environment working in three-day sprints with a product owner and Scrum master.  Participated in daily standups to discuss the progression of the project and deadlines, kept track of tasks using Trello, and built a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) by focusing on ten user stories.

MVP

*Log In*

As a user of the meal planning application, I can “log in” so that I access my account data.


*Create User*

As a new user, I can create an account so that I can start adding recipes and creating meal plans.


*View Recipes*

As a user, I can view a list of recipes I previously saved so that I can find one to view its details or edit it.


*View Recipe Details*

As a user, I can view a recipe while I’m cooking so that it’s easier to prepare it correctly.


*Add Recipe to Library*

As a user, I can add a recipe to my library of recipes so that it can be added to a meal plan.  
A recipe consists of a list of ingredients and preparation instructions.


*Modify a Recipe*


As a user, I can update a recipe I saved previously by adding or removing ingredients or modifying the preparation instructions.


*Add Ingredient*

As a user, I can add ingredients to the system if my expected ingredient is not shown.


*Create a Meal Plan*

As a user, I can create a new meal plan so that I can add meals to the plan.
One meal plan = one week


*View Meal Plan Details*

As a user, I can view a meal plan in order to decide whether I want to use it this week.


*Add Meal to Plan*

I can add a meal to a meal plan. A “meal” is made up of one or more recipes chosen from my library of saved recipes. For instance, the main dish and a couple of side dishes.
